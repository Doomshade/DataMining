This tool is used for creating lines. The application works as follows (with endpoint at DBPedia https://www.dbpedia.org/):\n\
The tool always looks for "subject-predicate-object" triples. The subject can be "Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor", the predicate "predecessor", and the subject is the result of this query, which will be displayed on the line.\n\
\n\
Create a line at the beginning (%1$s) or with %2$s -> %3$s and give it a name, e.g. "Followers of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor".\n\
Then the subject must be found - i.e. "Karel IV.". You call up the dialog by right-clicking on the line and "%4$s" (%5$s). Type "Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor" into the text box.\n\
If you enter an invalid subject, a warning will be displayed. If the subject is valid, the predicate selection will be displayed (see below).\n\
\n\
Now let's choose a predicate. There are many to choose from - the tool does not know whether lines can be created from the given attribute. The tool only filters such predicates,\n\
to which correspond objects that don't lead anywhere (e.g. date of birth). It is also possible for the predicate to occur in duplicate, however\n\
WARNING: these are not duplicate results, predicates are not equivalent - each predicate can form a line differently.\n\
The same is the case with the predecessor - if you select the first result, the line will be created without any problem according to\n\
data in DBPedia, as it is a so-called ontology. However, the results may not be what you want - the second result will prompt you in case of ambiguity,\n\
how to continue to form the line. Right from the beginning, it is not clear how to continue, because Charles IV. has several ancestors from different dynasties.\n\
\n\
Finally, you have to select "from-to" - for example, "from when" "to when" the monarch ruled, or when he was born and when he died. You first select the start ("from"), then the end ("to").\n\
If you don't select a start, a warning will appear. If you do not select an end, the tool assumes that it is a "moment" - a sequence of events that occurred on the day of the selected start (e.g. the beginning of the ruler's reign).\n\
The tool now knows how to search, however there may still be ambiguities that it will ask you about via dialog. From the dialogue, select one subject at a time to continue with.
