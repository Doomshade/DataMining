/**
 * <p>A listener for request callbacks. For example when a {@link DataNode} is created the front end would want to handle that fact and update the UI.</p>
 * <p>IMPORTANT: The methods are not necessarily called on the FX UI thread! Make sure to update UI on the UI thread via {@link javafx.application.Platform#runLater(Runnable)}. Also note that if you
 * want to be 100% thread safe do make the methods {@code synchronized}.</p>
 * <p>This class is designed to handle most of the UI related changes via several callbacks. Nothing should be updated on the UI prior to the callback, however it's not guaranteed</p>
